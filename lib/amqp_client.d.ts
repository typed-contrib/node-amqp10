/**
 * AMQPClient is the top-level class for interacting with node-amqp10.  Instantiate this class, connect, and then send/receive
 * as needed and behind the scenes it will do the appropriate work to setup and teardown connections, sessions, and links and manage flow.
 * The code does its best to avoid exposing AMQP-specific types and attempts to convert them where possible, but on the off-chance you
 * need to speak AMQP-specific (e.g. to set a filter to a described-type), you can use node-amqp-encoder and the
 * translator adapter to convert it to our internal types.  See simple_eventhub_test.js for an example.
 *
 * Configuring AMQPClient is done through a Policy class.  By default, DefaultPolicy will be used - it assumes AMQP defaults wherever
 * possible, and for values with no spec-defined defaults it tries to assume something reasonable (e.g. timeout, max message size).
 *
 * To define a new policy, you can merge your values into an existing one by calling AMQPClient.policies.merge(yourPolicy, existingPolicy).
 * This does a deep-merge, allowing you to only replace values you need.  For instance, if you wanted the default sender settle policy to be auto-settle instead of mixed,
 * you could just use
 *
 <pre>
 var AMQP = require('amqp10');
 var client = new AMQP.Client(AMQP.Policy.merge({
   senderLink: {
     attach: {
       senderSettleMode: AMQP.Constants.senderSettleMode.settled
     }
   }
 });
 </pre>
 *
 * Obviously, setting some of these options requires some in-depth knowledge of AMQP, so I've tried to define specific policies where I can.
 * For instance, for Azure EventHub connections, you can use the pre-build EventHubPolicy.
 *
 * Also, within the policy, see the encoder and decoder defined in the send/receive policies.  These define what to do with the message
 * sent/received, and by default do a simple pass-through, leaving the encoding to/decoding from AMQP-specific types up to the library which
 * does a best-effort job.  See EventHubPolicy for a more complicated example, turning objects into UTF8-encoded buffers of JSON-strings.
